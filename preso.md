# **Open source And Open APIs**

* Definitions
* Why
* Security
* Challenges

---

# **Open Source**

> adjective
>
> denoting software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.

---

# **Open Source**

> Software that is developed collaboratively in a distributed fashion

---

# **Open API**

> An open API (often referred to as a *public API*) is a publicly available application programming interface that provides developers with programmatic access to a proprietary software application or web service.

Essentially `OPEN == PUBLIC` in this case.

---

# **Why? (BCC internal view)**

* We are not a Software Development company
	* Software is not a goal, it's a tool
* Forces good practices on us
	* No more *security by obscurity* if we cant obscure anything
* Easier to introduce new collaborators
	* There is no need for any additional effort from dev side
* Only sane way to encourage volunteer contributors
	* No one has a day to spend chasing leads who to talk to for access A and credential B

---

# **Why? (Outside view)**

* Transparency
* "I want to do something for BCC but I don't know how to start?"
* BCC has that cool system for doing X. I wonder if we could do the same?
* Sharing of ideas
* I want build scoreboard for my local church, can I get XYZ?

---

# **Security**

* Because she can't read the code it's harder to exploit
	* > Rogues are very keen in their profession, and know already much more than we can teach them. -[Alfred Charles Hobbs], 1851
	* Anyone determined enough to read code is determined enough to do other things (decompile for ex)

---

# **Security**
* Exploiting software is "far down" on the list
	* Weak passwords and Human error account for well over 70% of information leaks
	* [haveibeenpwned.com] has a public list of 613M passwords that are leaked
* There are many positive people out there
	* Security issues have been actively reported

---

# **Challenges**

* Initial release of existing things
* Access (BCC Login)
* Initial setup / Readme
* Separate media and graphical profile from code
	* Nope, the BCC logo is not for anyone to use
* Communication
